The **Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL)** is a powerful feature in Windows that allows users to run Linux Distribution natively. However, if misconfigured, it can be a vector for privilege escalation or unauthorized execution of commands

### Finding WSL Binaries 

to locate the binaries associated with WSL on a windows system, tou can use the followinf commands:

**1. Finding ``bash.exe``**

``bash.exe`` was used in earlier version of WSL (WSL 1) as the entry point before WSL 2 was introduced.

```cmd
where /R c:\windows bash.exe
```

**2. Finding ``wsl.exe`` (WSL2)**

The modern ``wsl.exe`` command is used for WSL2, which runs the Linux kernel on windows

### How WSL can be abused for privilege escalation

1.  **WSL with Sudo (Escalation via WSL)**

If **WSL** is configured to run as an elevated user, it can be used as a **priviled escalation tool**. Commands like ``sudo`` allows attackers to execute commands as root inside the WSL enviornment, which may lead to system compromise.

2.  **Abusing WSL to bypass Execution Policy**

Running Linux-based payloads through **WSL** may bypass Windows execution policies such as **AppLocker** or **Windows Defender Application Control(WDAC)**, if not configured correctly. This could allow an attacker to execute unauthorized or malicious code

3.  **Accessing Windows File through WSL**

WSL provides access to windows file system through mounted directories (``/mnt/c``, ``/mnt/d``). This could be leveraged to manipulate files in system directories like ``C:\Windows\System32``, which may lead to further exploitation

4.  **WSL vulnerabilities in Older Versions**

**WSL 1** has known issues with privilege escalation, and an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if the system is running an outdated version of WSL. Ensure **WSL 2** is used for better isolation and security
