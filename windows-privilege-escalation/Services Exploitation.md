## Exploitable Service Misconfigurations

Windows services can be misconfigured in several ways. Attackers can abuse the following conditions.

### DLL Hijacking (IMP)

*   Occurs when a service loads DLLs from directories where attackers can write files.
*   Attackers places a malicious DLL in the load path, which gets  executed under the context of the service.

### Insecure Service Permissions (binPath Abuse)

*   Permissions on the service configuration (especially ``binPath``) allow attackers to change what binary the service runs.

### Service Registry Key Permissions

*   If attackers have write access to service registry keys (e.g. ``NTLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\ServiceName``). they can change the binary path.

### Unquoted Service Path (IMP)

*   Services with paths that include spaces and are unquoted can be hijacked.
*   Example : Path = ``C:\Program Files\Some Service\service.exe``
    Malicious ``C:\Program.exe`` can be executed instead.


### Insecure File Permissions (Service Executable File Path)

*   If the binary a servce points to can be overwritten, the attacker can replace it with payload
